# Project 2: Find the Hat game

Objective:
1. To build an interactive terminal game

Tools:
Javascript, Node.Js, Visual Studio Code

Scenario:
The 'player' has lost the hat in a field full of holes. They must navigate their way back to find the hat without stepping on the holes or outside the field.

Game Control:
1. W,S,A,D - for up, down, left, right direction
2. Game ends when player reach the hat ("Congrats! You found the magic hat!")
3. Game ends when player step on a hole ("Oops! You drop into a hole!")
4. Game ends when player step out of the field ("Oh No! You have fallen into the dark abyss..")

Miscellaneous:
1. Colours using terminal-kit (https://www.npmjs.com/package/terminal-kit)
2. Randomize starting point of the player
3. pathCharacter(*) do not leave trails of stars behind, making it easier to see if player moves back


Reflection:
Things I like about this project is the ability to "create a game" and customizing it. As a gamer myself, the project makes me more appreciative of game creators (I can't even begin to imagine the amount of brain juice, sweat and tears pour into them). Initially I was struggling with moving of the player and trying to understand how 2D array works. This leads me to googling for more informations and samples to have a deeper understanding.
